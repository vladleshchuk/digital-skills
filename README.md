Master's Thesis Project: "Digital Skills"
A web platform for managing and taking educational courses on digital skills, developed as part of a master's thesis.

This project is a practical implementation of a Corporate Information System (CIS) in the form of a Learning Management System (LMS). The work was based on the methodological guidelines for the "Corporate Information Systems" discipline.

The system allows for the administration of educational content (courses, modules, tasks) and provides students with the ability to take courses, track their progress, and receive a certificate upon completion.

🚀 Core Functionality
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): A complete authentication system with two access levels:


Student: Can register , take an assessment test, enroll in courses, complete tasks, and download a certificate .




Admin: Has full CRUD access to manage courses, modules, and tasks.


Assessment System: An initial 5-question test to determine the user's least developed digital skills (based on the tests table ). The test results can recommend specific course categories.


Learning Progress: Each user has individual progress for every course, tracked in the enrollments table . Statuses are updated automatically:

Not started

In progress (after completing the first task)

Completed (after all tasks are finished)


Dynamic Document Generation: Automatic generation of a .docx certificate  upon successful course completion. The system uses a template (certificate_template.docx) and populates it with user data ({users_name}, {course_title}, etc.) .





Dynamic Filtering: The main courses page features server-side filtering by title (search), dimensions (checkboxes), difficulty (checkboxes), and duration (radio buttons) .

🛠️ Technology Stack
This project is built on server-side JavaScript using an MVC-like architecture.

🖥️ Backend
Node.js: The runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server.


Express.js: The primary framework for handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware .

Handlebars (hbs): The template engine used for Server-Side Rendering (SSR). It assembles .hbs files (like index.hbs, menu.hbs, courses.hbs) into a single HTML page on the server before sending it to the user .

express-session: Used for authentication and managing user sessions.

mysql2: The driver (library) that allows the Node.js application to connect and execute queries against the MySQL database.


docxtemplater & pizzip: Libraries used to generate .docx files (certificates) based on a template .

🎨 Frontend
HTML5 / CSS3: Structure and styling for all pages.

Bootstrap 4: The main UI framework used for the grid system, cards, buttons, navigation (navbar), forms, and accordions.


Google Fonts: Custom fonts (Montserrat for headings, Roboto for text) to enhance typography .

Bootstrap Icons: Used for icons in the menu and on buttons.


JavaScript (AJAX): "Plain" JS (XMLHttpRequest) is used on the start.hbs login page for asynchronous authentication and error display without a full page reload .

🗃️ Database
MySQL (MariaDB): The relational database used to store all data (users, courses, modules, tasks, progress, tests).


XAMPP: The local server stack used to run Apache and MySQL .

Navicat / MySQL-Front: GUI tools used for designing and administering the database.

🚀 Installation and Setup
Clone the repository.

Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd digital-skills
Install all required dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Database Setup:

Ensure you have a local MySQL server running (e.g., via XAMPP ).

Create a new database named digitalskills.

Import the digitalskills.sql database dump into your DBMS.

Check the connection settings (host, user, password) in index.js within the createStore() function .

Certificate Setup:

Create a file named certificate_template.docx in the project's root directory.

Design it as a certificate and add the necessary placeholder tags: {users_name}, {course_title}, {completion_date}.

Run the server in development mode (with nodemon):

Bash

npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
